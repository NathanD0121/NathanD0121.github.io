        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="PP1.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <p>
            I am a student who is undertaking a masters degree in Cyber Security at Birmingham City University. I have a first class degree in Computer Science from Birmigham City University.
            I have experiance working in the IT industry from my placement year where I worked with SAP software. 
            <br><br>
            I am particularly intrested in the dangers posed to cyber security by Artifical Intelligence (AI) and on the other side, how AI can be used to improve cyber security. I am also intrested in the Internet of Things (IoT). I am always eager to further my knowlegde of computing and I try to stay up to date with the latest technological advances. I also have a keen intrest in robotics.
            <br><br>
            My greatest achievement to date has been finishing my degree. This required me to learn new skills and technologies in a short amount of time to produce an assignment or take an exam.
            In undertaking my degree I have learnt a great deal about myself as a person and I am looking forward to a future in computing.
            <br><br>
            As a teenager I was in the Air Cadets for six years and reached the rank of Flight Sergeant. In this position I was responsible for around twenty cadets.
            Some of the activities I took part in included: flying, shooting, field craft, outdoor survival and first aid.
            I was also part of the Fire Cadets for two years.
            <br><br>
            Outside of computing I am an avid music enthusiast and can regularly be found attending gigs. I also enjoy playing the guitar and meeting up with my friends.
