        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Final Year Project</h3>
        <p>
            During my final year at university I undertook a research focused project. The aim of this project was to use machine learning to build a system that could analyse ECG data.
            The project looked at time series classification, ensemble methods and symbolic representation.
            The project's findings are recorded in my dissertation on the subject and can be downloaded
            <a href="Time%20Series%20Classification%20for%20ECG%20Data.pdf" download>here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>SAP Solution Manager Upgrade and Migration </h3>
        <p>
            While on my placement year one of the major projects that I was a part of was to carry out an upgrade of the company's SAP Solution Manager (Solman) system and to migrate it from on-premise data centres into Microsoft Azure. I undertook both technical and project management roles throughout the duration of the project.
        </p>
        <h3>Text Based Adventure Game</h3>
        <p>
            One of the projects in my second year at university was to build a text based game using the declarative programming paradigm. The language used was F# and this project was carried out in small groups.
        </p>
        <h3>Library System</h3>
        <p>
            One of my first projects at university was to build a library system that allowed users to add, delete and search for different books. It was built using an object-oriented programming model in Java.
        </p>
        <h3>Machine Learning Project</h3>
        <p>
            This was a machine learning project that looked at if a student's grade could be accurately predicted based on home lifestyle factors. This project was done in small groups and compared the effectiveness
            of several different algorithms. My algorithm was Naive Bayes and the project was written in Python.
        </p>
        <h3>Online Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe</h3>
        <p>
            This project was to build an online game and focused on advanced programming techniques such as parallel programming and client-server architecture. It was written in Java.
        </p>
        <h3>Tic Tac Toe with GUI</h3>
        <p>
            This was the first project I had at university. The project was to build a simple game of Tic Tac Toe with a graphical user interface (GUI). It was written in Python.
        </p>
        <h3>Mobile and Wearable Application</h3>
        <p>
            This project looked at building an android application and also developing a wearable (smartwatch) component. It was written in Java.
