            "Nathan was able to run the landscape meetings and provide clear descriptions of what the landscape intentions were, giving the information they needed to plan their work.
            The landscape plan is a complicated document with lots of detail. He has also shown to be capable in picking up new technologies and processes, and being able to then turn that knowledge
            around quickly - e.g. working on building system reporting and monitoring dashboards. Notably he was also working directly with third party vendors."
            <br><br>
            "Nathan is very peronable and friendly. He is confident in meetings and comes accross well. He is well organised and does not let things slip. He has picked up knowledge quickly and can be
            left with tasks with little supervision."
            <br><br>
            "I am extremely pleased to be able to provide my final comments on Nathan following his year internship with us. I think that the whole team has found it engaging, intresting and rewarding
            having Nathan working as part of the technical team. When Nathan arrived he appeared shocked by the scale of the organisation. He leaves us with a great impression of someone who is
            organised in his ways of working, is able to network and build very effective working relationships with different tiers of management both onsite and remotely. He is able to understand
            and effectively communicate complex technical solutions. He has achieved this by working hard and being prepared to ask questions."
            <br><br>
            "Nathan is someone that I have been able to greatly rely on. He has been given some critical responsibilities within the organisation. The way that he has handled himself and others has been admirable.
            He is generally very open but was maybe a little shy at the start. We are able to trust him implicitly with the tasks provided."
            <br><br>
            "He is a responsable young man. He likes to explore new things when given the opportunity."
            <br><br>
            "Nathan's quality of work has placed him as one of the top students that I have supervised. He is a self-learner and self-motivated student. He has shown very strong technical and discipline skills.
            He strives to deliver his work to the best standards and on time. He has a very good understanding of machine learning concepts. He is an independent researcher and always shows enthusiasm to learn more."
