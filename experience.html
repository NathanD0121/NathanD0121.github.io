        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Mondelez International</h3>
        <h4>July 2018 - June 2019</h4>
        <p>
            I undertook a placement year at Mondelez International as an ITS Intern. In my time here I worked as part of the SAP technical team and was involved in various projects.
            Some of the core tasks involved was project management, technical planning and system configuration.

        <h3>Birmingham City University</h3>
        <h4>October 2017 - January 2018</h4>
        <p>
            During my second year at university I had the role of technical demonstator. In this role I assisted in teaching first year students and specifically focused on teaching programming in Python.
            The students had various levels of knowledge. Some were new to programming and others were experianced coders.

        <h3>Morrisons</h3>
        <h4>June 2015 - September 2016, June 2017 - September 2017</h4>
        <p>
            My primary role was a sales assistant in the grocery department. I filled the shelves, worked on the checkouts and helped customers if they had any difficulties.
            Addionally, I was trained on the warehouse which involved loading and unloading lorries. This was a highly demanding role which required good time keeping skills.
            I often worked late shifts so was left to run the grocery department by myself. While being independent I still had to embody the Morrison’s “One team” motto where everyone 
            would work together regardless of skills or job title which really emphasised the team spirt. In my time here, I was also awarded the HOT employee of the month for my excellent customer service skills.
